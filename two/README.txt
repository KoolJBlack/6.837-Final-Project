I just ran using the make

I didnot collaborate with anyone. 

For references, I read http://www.glprogramming.com/red/. I primarily used chapters 4 and 5 for the coloring of the mesh. 

There are no problems.

I did extra credit easy for multi coloring the mesh. There is one issue: the color weighting happens when the mesh is updated, so when its initially drawn, all of the vertecies are white. Only after a joint is moved will the colors show up.

I have no comments.
